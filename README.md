# How to submit your astronomy software and data reduction scripts

When you write an astronomy paper, you use software to carry out your data analysis. To generate the plots and figures you use a series of computer scripts that use this software and produce the graphical output as plots and figures.

If you haven't done so already, register for an [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) Identifier. The sites mentioned below have tight integration with ORCID, so it simplifies matters. Here is [my ORCID ID and page](http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7064-8270).

Procedure for software packages:

  * Learn [version control using GIT](http://nyuccl.org/pages/GitTutorial/) and how to upload your software to [github](https://github.com/). Make sure you choose a permissive license for your software - I have used the [BSD 3-clause license](https://github.com/mkenworthy/pds_110_exorings/blob/master/LICENSE).
  * Register the software at [Astrophysics Source Code Library](http://ascl.net/) (Q: does this happen automatically or should you be active in it?)
  * Optionally upload it to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) (Q: why Zenodo over any other storage place?)


Procedure for plots and figure scripts:

  * Code it in a Jupyter notebook and upload to github:
 example: [Analysis of PDS 110 photometry and making Figure 5](https://github.com/mkenworthy/pds_110_exorings) and it also automatically [displays your Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/mkenworthy/pds_110_exorings/blob/master/plot_PDS_110_exoring_fig_5.ipynb)
  * Submit figures with accompanying explanation to [Figshare](https://figshare.com/).
